Be careful, this is in the app store now and there is no dev/test/prod env.  
# buffaloretailgroupmap

This is to be a maps app for Buffalo stores, shops, retail, whatever.

## Getting Started

I'm just learning Flutter, so this will be messy and probably wrong in places.  But it should work!

need to figure out, or rather remember how, to get the google maps/api to work locally for ios.


icons generation is the suuuuuuuuuuuck!

you should probably understand xcode
and how signing works for ios/xcode

and cocoapods.  and what to do when cocoapods gets stuck.
and gradle for android.
